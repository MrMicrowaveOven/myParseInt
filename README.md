# myParseInt

Just a quick attempt at mimicing the functionality of JavaScript's myParseInt.  After all, you never really know a function until you write it yourself!

## To Use

Here's a quick one-liner to clone it, install Mocha, and run all the tests.

`git clone https://github.com/MrMicrowaveOven/myParseInt.git && cd myParseInt && npm install && npm test`
